Tuesday, August 9, 2022 - This is my first Javascript project. I will build a simple rock, paper, scissors game that can be played in the console. Later, I will add UI.

Saturday, August 20, 2022 - I have completed the first version of the game, running in the Javscript console. The main challenges I faced were figuring out how to correctly use an array to randomize the computer's turn, implementing a loop to repeat the single round function, and correctly incrementing the player score and computer score. I will now continue with The Odin Project's lessons and work on adding UI.

Wednesday, September 7, 2022 - I have learned a bit about the DOM and will now implement a UI into my RPS game.

Sunday, September 11, 2022 - I have finished the RPS game UI. I added a few extra bits beyond the scope of the TOP propect, including a reset button and an overlay that mimics CRT scanlines. The CRT overlay looks wonky on mobile so I removed it on displays less than 1000 pixels wide.
