Tuesday, August 9, 2022 - This is my first Javascript project. I will build a simple rock, paper, scissors game that can be played in the console. Later, I will add a GUI.

Saturday, August 20, 2022- I have completed the first version of the game, running in the Javscript console. The main challenges I faced were figuring out how to correctly use an array to randomize the computer's turn, implementing a loop to repeat the single round function, and correctly incrementing the player score and computer score. I will now continue with The Odin Project's lessons and work on adding a GUI.
